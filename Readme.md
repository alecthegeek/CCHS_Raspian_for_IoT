These scripts are designed to support @geekscape's Embedded Network Robots
workshop at the Melbourne Connected Community Hacker Space. They should be
generally useful for people working on Internet of Things projects
(.e.g mesh networking, robotics, Arduino, etc etc).

After following this process you should have

1. A fully updated Raspian system
2. Working WiFi
3. Installation of lm-sensors and [i2c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) software
4. Raspian configured for your environment (location, language etc)
5. A few select development tools installed (Vim, Emacs, Git, GNU Screen, tmux, ack-grep and Subversion)
6. The default user account renamed to something of your own choice and your own choice of hostname (optional)
7. [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) library
8. Working [Zero Conf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_(software)) (to access your Pi by hostname instead of IP address)
9. The [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/wiki/) installed and ready to use (optional)
10. Java development kit installed for older images (optional -- larger SD card recommended)
11. [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) development environment (optional)
12. [NodeBots](http://nodebots.io/) (optional). Will also install Arduino and Java SDK.

13. A optional script is provided to install support for [M9Design](http://www.m9design.co/)'s MeshThing IPv6 mesh networking platform. After running the `RasPiI0T-1` and `RasPiI0T-2` (see below) run

`wget https://tinyurl.com/meshthing -O - | bash`


<!--
13. A optional script is provided to install Minecraft and set up the API for development. It is *not* depenedent on the other scripts. To install Minefraft type the following at the terminal

`wget http://tinyurl.com/MinecraftOnPi -O - | bash`

-->

NB These scripts assume you are using Raspian Linux (Debian Linux)

<!-- ROS installed as per [http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Raspbian]
## Instructions
-->
* Write  the Raspian image to an SD card in the normal way. 4Gb is is big enough
for the basics
* Boot the Pi from the new SD image and log in as the default user (initially `pi`)
* If the Raspi Config menu utility appears then configure your keyboard and exit
back to the command prompt
* Make sure your Pi has access to the Internet
 * If you have a supported WiFi adapter you can configure it as follows:
  `wpa_passphrase <SSID> <WPA_PASSWORD> | 
          sudo tee -a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
   then reboot and log as the default user again

* Now run the following command.

`wget https://tinyurl.com/RasPiIoT-1 -O - | bash`



Pi computer now reboots

* Log in as the default user and run the following commands

`wget https://tinyurl.com/RasPiIoT-2 -O - | bash`

the following variation is useful as it provides a log of the script output with total time.

`script install2.script -c "time bash <(wget -O - https://tinyurl.com/RasPiIoT-2)"`

This is a long process and will require user input at various stages.

WARNING: Installing and building Robot Operating System (ROS) takes appro 4 hours.

At the end the Pi will reboot


You can use the already existing default user account for development or feel free to create a different user account if you want. The rest
of these notes should be run as that development account.
  * Edit `~/.bashrc` and add the line `source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash` (if you are using the default user account this has already been done for you)
  * Logout and login again
  * Read and review [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/StartGuide]
  * Run the following ROS tutorials

   [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment#Create_a_ROS_Workspace]

   [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem]

  * Run the ROS tutorials. E.g. This requires that you have X running as you will need to run multiple terminals at once and display an image.

  Terminal session 1: Run the command `cd catkin_ws; roscore`

  Terminal session 2: Run the command `cd catkin_ws; rosrun roscpp_tutorials talker`

  Terminal session 3: Run the command `cd catkin_ws; rosrun roscpp_tutorials listener`

  Terminal session 4: Run the command `cd catkin_ws; rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph `

You should now have a correctly installed, tested and configured ROS on Linux system
Now continue Andyâ€™s notes at ``http://tinyurl.com/enr-workshop-1n``

Additional Notes

* This image is _possibly_ missing following Occidentalis [http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2] features:
  * Kernel modules for: DS1307, AD626 I2C digipots, HMC6352, BMP085, ADS1015

* Run the command `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` on a regular basis
(e.g. once a week) to keep the software up to date

* These scripts can be re-run as needed. There is not need to re-image your SD card beforehand.

#TO DO

1. Ask user all questions at the start and then perform an unattended install
2. Better error detection
